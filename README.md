# Command & Construct

This is an open-development real-time strategy (RTS) game project made in [Construct](https://www.construct.net/).

Read more about it and follow along the development process on [Ashley's blog](https://www.construct.net/en/blogs/ashleys-blog-2) or on Twitter at [@AshleyGullen](https://www.twitter.com/AshleyGullen)!

## Contributions

As noted in the [first blog post](https://www.construct.net/en/blogs/ashleys-blog-2/im-going-game-1596), this project won't be accepting contributions, at least at first. It's more just open development process than an open source project.

## Try the project

To try the project, click the green *Code* button and choose the *Download ZIP* option. Extract the files to a folder. Open Construct in Chrome or Edge and use the *Open local project folder* option, and pick the folder containing the *project.c3proj* file. You may need to use the latest beta release at times - see the [releases list](https://www.construct.net/en/make-games/releases).
